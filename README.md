# **Monitoring Bacterial Movement and Populations**
## _Description_
This project aims to compare the bacterial movement and population growth under specific nutrient or stress conditions. 

The data were obtained from a simulation of bacterial tracking experiment. Each input contains the ID of experiment run, number of bacteria tracked, their 3D momentum components (px, py, pz) in 10⁻²⁰ kg m/s and ID of bacterial strain or genetic variant.

The data set contains following bacterial strains:

* _E. coli WT_ (wild type)
* _E. coli mutant_
* _Bacillus subtilis WT_
* _Bacillus subtilis mutant_
* _Pseudomonas aeruginosa WT_
* _Pseudomonas aeruginosa antibiotic-resistant_
* _Streptococcus pneumoniae_
* _Capsule-deficient streptococcus pneumoniae_
* _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_
* _Drug-resistant mycobacterium tuberculosis_
* _Salmonella enterica_
* _Salmonella mutant_

## _Research Questions_
The project focuses on answering the following research questions:

1. What are the average counts and statistical uncertainties of each bacterial strain?
2. Is there any asymmetry between the normal and the mutant strain, if so - how large is it?
3. Is there any asymmetry between the normal and the mutant strain as a function of their momentum?

## _Installation_
1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed. No additional packages are required, only Python's standart library.

2. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sofijaponomarjova/Monitoring-Bacterial-Movement-and-Population.git
cd Monitoring-Bacterial-Movement-and-Population
```
**Alternatively, download the repository as a ZIP file:**

**Dataset**

You can downoload the dataset files here: https://surfdrive.surf.nl/index.php/s/7udCnWTk4yMUASD 

## _Usage_
1. Open the folder
2. Run in Terminal file of your choice:

```python3 *file of your choice*```

* task2.py - cleans the data and then calculates the momentum for each bacteria
* week3.py - calculates the average amount of a bacterial strain per event/experiment in 1 sample
* week4.py - calculates the average amount of a bacterial strain per event/experiment in all 10 samples
